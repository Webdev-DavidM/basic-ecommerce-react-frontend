This project is a simple e-commerce shop. The app is made with react hooks and redux using the the latest redux-toolkit technology. The app has an express backend connected to a mongo db database. The product images are uploaded using an npm package called multer. The express backend api is hosted on heroku and is set up to handle cors.
